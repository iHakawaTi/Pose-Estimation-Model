# Pose-Estimation-Model

## Overview

Pose-Estimation-Model is a real-time human pose estimation system built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**. This project enables efficient detection and tracking of body landmarks, making it useful for applications like fitness tracking, motion analysis, augmented reality, and interactive applications.

## Features

- Real-time pose estimation  
- 33-point body landmark detection  
- Lightweight and efficient  
- Easy integration with other projects  

## How It Works

1. Captures video frames using OpenCV.  
2. Uses MediaPipe's Pose Estimation solution to detect body landmarks in real-time.  
3. Draws key points and skeletal connections for visualization.  
4. Outputs the processed video stream with pose estimation enabled.
